All fully capitalized methods are top level priority. Other camel case methods are lower level utility type functions.


Need to find a way to add rendering on click with velocity line as well

rewrite line to be an error, maybe build custom svg?

On pause, maybe display all the internally stored velocity arrows? write function to take arbitrary body and draw the arrow rather than storing all the contents of the thing in a nested struct which is nasty
